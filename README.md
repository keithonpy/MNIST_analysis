# Handwritten digits analysis
In this repository, we trained the models on the classification of handwritten digits with MNIST dataset and compared their errors



The machine learning models used are as follows:
* `ML_models/linear_regression.py`: Linear regression model
* `ML_models/svm.py`: Support Vector Machine
* `ML_models/softmax.py`: Softmax regression model
* `ML_models/feature.py`: Principal Component Analysis and cubic feature
* `ML_models/kernel.py`: Polynomial kernel and RBF kernel
* Neural Network
* Convolution Neural Network
